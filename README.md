# Web-scraping-project

### Description
This repository contains a short account of a topic that has been rather prominent in Romanian politics for the past two years, namely the
question whether a referendum should be organised to define the traditional family in the Romanian constitution. 
The main output, an article, is centered around web-based data (collected from Google Trends and Wikipedia). There is an original version of the article, focusing more on conceptual and methodological issues, and a revised version, which goes more into the details of the political debate.

### Author
The code and the article were submitted as the final project in the "Web Data Collection and Social Media Mining" at the Hertie School of Governance, spring semester 2018. Both the code and the article are my own work.
